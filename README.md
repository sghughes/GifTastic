# GifTastic Sports

Using the Giphy API, sports gifs can be generated when each sport button is clicked. Once gifs have loaded on the page, each gif can be clicked on to start or stop gif animation. 

Add a new gif button of your choosing to the "add new gif button" input section. Once the button is added, it will generate gifs in the same manner as the existing gif buttons.
